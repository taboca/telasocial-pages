Ribeirão Preto SP and Porto Alegre RS (June 7, 2013) — Tela Social Communication platform will support this year's [FISL14](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/14) Conference in Porto Alegre from 3th to 6th of July. The event, the 14th International Free Software Forum, is one of the major open source events in Brazil. Tela Social will support the event's participants with a real-time content experience tailored to the participants and available in HD TV display appliances distributed at the [Center of Events PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/cepuc/). 

The project, referred as #FISL14 Web Dashboard, is the result of a partnership that reflects [ASL](http://softwarelivre.org/) and [Tela Social](http://www.telasocial.com]'s goals to support participants with a modern communication solution which is standards-compliant and Web based. 

The user experience will be available using high-definition display panels and a small PC appliance next to each TV. The whole content is tailored to interests of participants using channels defined by the event's communication team.  The infrastructure, which is based on W3C standards, uses a browser engine appproach to bring a visual programming that is connected with content channels in the domain of FISL and extened social networks. 

The dashboard experience has a layout with various segments as shown in the followig figure:

## Background History 

The “Tela Social” has history in FISL. Its first version was launched in 2010 with support from FISL. It was a successful implementation with a project coordinated by Mr. Lucas Alberto (GT Cultura). In the first version, the project was comprised of three (3) screens and a big screen that used a projector. The original version featured Twitter, Identi.ca, Flickr, and addicional components that displayed news and alers. Since that, Tela Social has expanded to other major events in Brazil and it reached new capabilities, such as the component that creates a content grid of events based in the ICS format, which is the format supported by Google Calendar. 

## Opportunity at FISL 

The project FISL14/ASL is an opportunity for developers and also professionals in adminstration and media. The project will select four contributors who should be involved in the project and should also participate in the event with guest invitations. There is also an opportunity for a software engineer with interest in client and server architecture. The customization project, with ASL will be available on a GitHub repository and should be compatible with the platform/system of TelaSocial, which is open source.
