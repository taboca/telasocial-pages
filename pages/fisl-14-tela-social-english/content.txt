## Background History 

Tela Social means social screen. The project has history at FISL, with its first version launched in 2010 with support from FISL/ASL. That pioneer project had FISL coordination program by [Lucas Alberto](https://twitter.com/lucasa). In the first version, the project was comprised of three (3) screens and a big screen that used a projector. The original version featured Twitter, Identi.ca, Flickr, and additional components that displayed news and alerts. Since that, Tela Social has expanded to other major events in Brazil and it reached new capabilities, such as the component that creates a content grid of events based in the ICS format, which is the format supported by Google Calendar.

## Opportunity at FISL 

The project FISL14/ASL is an opportunity for developers as well as professionals in administration and media. The project will select four contributors who should be involved in the project and should also participate in the event with guest invitations. There is also an opportunity for a software engineer with interest in client and server architecture. The customization project, with ASL, will be available on a GitHub repository and should be compatible with the platform/system of TelaSocial, which is open source.
